.# Abstract

This document describes a mechanism for efficiently and reversibly
encoding radio callsigns into compact numeric identifiers. It also
defines two addressing mechanisms using this numeric encoding: A new
adaptive link-layer addressing scheme (HAM-64) intended for use with
new link-layer networking protocols like ARNGLL (Up to 12 characters),
and an adaptation of EUI-48 and EUI-64 addresses (Up to 8 and 11
characters, respectively) intended for use with existing link layer
protocols.

While this callsign encoding/addressing schemes was developed for
amateur radio purposes, there is no technical reason why it could not
be used directly with other radio services that make use of ITU
callsigns.

# Introduction #

Radio callsigns are used to identify the source (and possibly the
destination) of licensed radio transmissions. Radio callsigns are
generally assigned to individuals or organizations for identification
purposes by the local regulatory authority, such as the FCC in the
United States.

Their presence in transmissions is often mandated by regulations,
which works well for voice and constant-wave (CW or morse-code) modes,
but doesn't work well for packet radio. AX.25, for example, imposes a
hard 6-character limit on callsign length. The longest callsign that
can currently be assigned to an individual is seven characters long,
which means that operators which are assigned seven-character
callsigns cannot legally use AX.25. Additionally, the callsign is
encoded as plain ASCII text, which is hardly the most compact
encoding.

Naively encoding a six-character callsign using ASCII requires at
least 48 bits. However if we encoded each character using just six
bits, this would make a six-character callsign take up only 36 bits.
This is certainly an improvement, but we can still do better!

Callsigns exclusively consist of a collection of letters (A thru Z)
and numeric digits (0 thru 9). There are also secondary suffixes which
can be appended with the slash character `/`, giving us a total of 37
individual symbols that can be present in a callsign. We can use this
limited character set to our advantage.

It turns out that if we limit ourselves to fewer than 40 different
possible symbols, we can store up to three characters in a 16-bit
block. Thus, we can store a six character callsign in just 32 bits, a
nine character callsign in 48 bits and a twelve character callsign in
64 bits. 12 characters is plenty of space for both a callsign *and* an
indicator suffix/prefix.

This document takes the basic premise described above and fleshes it
out into a full addressing specification by fully defining the
following:

*   A base-40 character set optimized for encoding ITU radio callsigns
*   A method for encoding three base-40 values (three callsign
    characters) within a 16-bit (two-byte) integer
*   A new 64-bit addressing format ('HAM-64') intended for use with
    with new link-layer packet radio protocols; capable of encoding
    callsigns up to 12 characters long
*   EUI-48 and EUI-64 callsign encodings intended for use with
    existing link-layer protocols; capable of encoding callsigns up to
    8 and 11 characters long

# Base-40 Character Set

Since there are a limited number of valid characters in an ITU radio
callsign, we represent each character in a callsign as number in
base-40. The character set we are using for this document defined below:

No. | Char | No. | Char | No. | Char | No. | Char
:--:|:----:|:---:|:----:|:---:|:----:|:---:|:----:
0   | *NUL*| 10  | `J`  | 20  | `T`  | 30  | `3`
1   | `A`  | 11  | `K`  | 21  | `U`  | 31  | `4`
2   | `B`  | 12  | `L`  | 22  | `V`  | 32  | `5`
3   | `C`  | 13  | `M`  | 23  | `W`  | 33  | `6`
4   | `D`  | 14  | `N`  | 24  | `X`  | 34  | `7`
5   | `E`  | 15  | `O`  | 25  | `Y`  | 35  | `8`
6   | `F`  | 16  | `P`  | 26  | `Z`  | 36  | `9`
7   | `G`  | 17  | `Q`  | 27  | `0`  | 37  | `/`
8   | `H`  | 18  | `R`  | 28  | `1`  | 38  | `-`
9   | `I`  | 19  | `S`  | 29  | `2`  | 39  | *ESC*/`^`

Where *NUL* is analogous to the ASCII *NUL* character, and *ESC* is
reserved for future use with a currently undefined and experimental
character escaping mechanism. (Should be rendered as `^`)

While this character set was designed specifically for use with the
16-bit chunk encoding defined in the next section, it is possible
that this character set could be useful for other purposes.

# 16-Bit Chunk Encoding {#chunk-encoding}

Using the previously defined character set, we can store three characters
as a single integer that fits within a 16-bit integer using the encoding:

    S = CHAR[0]*1600  +  CHAR[1]*40  +  CHAR[2]

Where `CHAR[0]` is the first (leftmost) character and `CHAR[2]` is the
last (rightmost) character in the "chunk".

We can then decode the original characters by reversing that process:

    CHAR[0] = S/1600 MOD 40
    CHAR[1] = S/40 MOD 40
    CHAR[2] = S MOD 40

When encoding a chunk that uses less than three characters, you would
set `CHAR[2]` and/or `CHAR[1]` (as appropriate) to the value 0
(*NUL*), indicating that there is not a character present in that
position. A chunk with no characters has the value zero.

To encode callsigns longer than three characters, multiple 16-bit chunks
are concatenated.

## Valid Chunk Encodings

When properly encoded, the value of a three-character chunk will be
either 0x0000 or between 0x0640 and 0xF9FF (inclusive). Any 16-bit
value not in this set of valid values **MUST NOT** be decoded using
the above mechanism. Such values **MAY** be used to indicate other
conditions (outlined below), or alternatively be considered invalid.

For example, the HAM-64 address format (outlined below) uses values
larger than 0xF9FF in the first chunk as a way to indicate that the
address is a special address.

# HAM-64 Address Format

HAM-64 is a new link-layer addressing format, similar in purpose to
the ubiquitous EUI-48 and EUI-64 address standards. It was specifically
designed for compactness and encoding clarity. It's features include:

*   Callsigns can be up to 12 characters long, allowing for long
    complex callsigns
*   Variable length encoding, allowing for 16-bit, 32-bit, 48-bit, and
    64-bit representations of 3, 6, 9, and 12 character callsigns
*   Broadcast and multicast addressing
*   Temporary short addresses

## Address Construction

HAM-64 addresses are encoded as four 16-bit big-endian "chunks",
which can contain up to three characters in each chunk. Chunks are
always stored in big-endian order.

When writing out a HAM-64 address, each chunk is shown as a four-digit
hexadecimal number, with each chunk separated by a dash `-`.

Lets have a look at a relatively short callsign, `N6DRC`:

 *  `N6D` encodes to `0x5CAC`
 *  `RC ` encodes to `0x70F8`

Thus, the full ham address for this callsign is `5CAC-70F8-0000-0000`.

By convention, all trailing chunks with the value `0x0000` are omitted
for brevity. Because the HAM-64 encoding of `N6DRC` has two trailing
zero chunks, `5CAC-70F8` is the preferred notation.

The process is identical for large callsigns, like `VI2BMARC50`:

 *  `VI2` encodes to `0x8B05`
 *  `BMA` encodes to `0x0E89`
 *  `RC5` encodes to `0x7118`
 *  `0  ` encodes to `0xA8C0`

Thus, the ham address for this callsign is `8B05-0E89-7118-A8C0`.
Since it is so long, there is no shorter representation.

## Adaptive Address Size

Since few amateur radio callsigns are longer than six characters, it
is expected that link-layer protocols using HAM-64 will want to
take the notation convention mentioned above to heart. By including
the source and destination address sizes in the link-layer header,
it is possible to omit all trailing zero-valued chunks from
header. This allows for common callsign lengths to be compactly
encoded without sacrificing the flexibility of using a longer
callsign when necessary.

## Special HAM-64 Addresses

All addresses where the first chunk is greater than or equal to 0xFA00
or less than 0x0640 are *special addresses*. Special addresses do not
have direct callsign representations. All addresses within this range
which are not explicitly defined below are to be considered **RESERVED**.

### Empty/Unspecified Callsign

The all-zero address (zero-length callsign) is **RESERVED** and
**MUST NOT** be sent over the wire. It is intended to be used
by implementations to represent an unspecified callsign.

### Temporary Short Addresses

16-bit HAM addresses between 0x0001 and 0x0639 (inclusive) are
reserved for *Temporary Short Addresses*. These are considered
placeholder values for an actual callsign. Temporary Short Addresses
are automatically leased for a period of time from a network
coordinator, the exact mechanism of which is out of the scope of this
document. These addresses MUST NOT be used outside of the context of a
network coordinator.

If the link-layer does not support temporary short addresses, these
addresses *MUST* be considered invalid.

### Broadcast

The broadcast (all-nodes) address for link-layers using HAM-64
addresses is defined as `FFFF-0000-0000-0000`.

### IPv6 Multicast

For link-layers using HAM-64 addresses for link-layer addressing,
IPv6 multicast MUST be implemented using addresses of the format
`FAxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx`, where `x` represents a special *reversed*
representation (defined below) of the IPv6 group-id.

For converting IPv6 multicast addresses into link-local HAM-64
multicast addresses, you MUST store the lower 7 octets of the
multicast group-id *in reverse order*. This takes advantage of the
fact that IPv6 multicast addresses tend to be zero-filled, allowing
for compact HAM-64 address representations. For example, a multicast
address of `ff02::1` would simply be the abbreviated ham address
`FA01`.

### IPv4 Multicast ###

IPv4 multicast can be implemented for link-layers using HAM-64
addresses using addresses of the format `FBxx-xxxx-0000-0000`, where
`x` represents the byte values for the last three octets of the IPv4
multicast address in reverse order. More specifically, a IPv4
multicast address `aaa.xxx.yyy.zzz` would have an associated HAM-64
address structured as `FBzz-yyxx-0000-0000'.

For example, the multicast address `224.0.0.251` would use the HAM-64
address `FBFB-0000-0000-0000` or just `FBFB` for short.

# EUI-48 and EUI-64 #

Sometimes it is useful to encode a callsign in an EUI-48 or EUI-64
address. This can be useful when operating standard Wi-Fi or 802.15.4
equipment under section 97 rules. While it is mathematically
impossible to encode every HAM-64 address as either an EUI-48 or an
EUI-64, a significant subset of addresses can be encoded: 8 characters
for EUI-48 and 11 characters for EUI-64. Under certain circumstances,
a full 9 or 12 characters can be encoded.

One of the goals of this encoding is to allow fast translation between
a "ham-address" and its associated EUI-64 or EUI-48---specifically, no
multiplication or division is required. Thus, 61 of the total 64-bits
have a direct one-to-one representation in an EUI-64 representation,
with the last three bits assumed to be zero (which they will be if the
last character is *NUL*).

## Encoding Process ##

While there are some other minor caveats (see EUI-64 section below),
the basic process for encoding works like this:

1.  Rotate the address by 8 bits to the right (so that the last byte
    becomes the first byte)
2.  Set the least-significant three bits of the first byte to '0',
    '1', '0'.

**NOTE:** Special ham addresses (defined in a section above) **MUST NOT**
be encoded as a EUI-48 or EUI-64 using this scheme! EUI-48 and EUI-64
addresses have their own multicast/broadcast mapping, which must be
used instead.

## Decoding Process ##

Not considering the minor caveats regarding decoding EUI-48-derived
EUI-64 addresses (See EUI-64 section below), the basic process for
decoding works like this:

1.  Verify the least significant bits of the first byte are 0, 1, 0.
2.  Verify the second byte is greater than 0x05. (Not strictly necessary,
    but will cause some non-callsign-encoded addresses to fail early)
3.  Clear the least-significant three bits of the first byte.
4.  Rotate the address by 8 bits to the left (so that the first byte
    becomes the last byte)
5.  Verify that each chunk is less than 0xFA00.
6.  Verify that the first chunk is greater than 0x063F.
7.  Verify that, when all characters are decoded, all characters after
    the first *NUL* are also *NUL*.

If any of the verify steps above fail then the address is either
corrupted or simply does not contain an encoded callsign.

Care was taken to ensure that a EUI-48-encoded ham address that has
been converted to a EUI-64 address does not parse correctly unless
converted to an EUI-48 first.

## EUI-48

This encoding allows us to encode an 8-digit callsign in a EUI-48:

       7 --Octet 1-- 0   7 --Octet 2-- 0   7 --Octet 3-- 0
    M +---------------+ +---------------+ +---------------+ ...
    S |C|C|C|C|C|0|1|0| |A|A|A|A|A|A|A|A| |A|A|A|A|A|A|A|A| ...
    B +---------------+ +---------------+ +---------------+ ...

         7 --Octet 4-- 0   7 --Octet 5-- 0   7 --Octet 6-- 0
    ... +---------------+ +---------------+ +---------------+ L
    ... |B|B|B|B|B|B|B|B| |B|B|B|B|B|B|B|B| |C|C|C|C|C|C|C|C| S
    ... +---------------+ +---------------+ +---------------+ B

Where:

 *  `A` is the 16-bit ham address encoding of the first, second, and
    third characters of the callsign. Valid values are between
    `0x0640` and `0xF9FF`, inclusive.
 *  `B` is the 16-bit ham address encoding of the fourth, fifth, and
    sixth characters of the callsign. Valid values are between
    `0x0000` and `0xF9FF`, inclusive.
 *  `C` is the most-significant 13-bits of the 16-bit ham address
    encoding of the seventh and eighth characters of the callsign. The
    least-significant three bits are always assumed to be zero. Note
    that octet 1 contains bits 7 thru 3 and octet 6 contains bits 15
    thru 8.

So, for `N6DRC`, `5CAC-70F8` becomes `02:5C:AC:70:F8:00`.

## EUI-64

The encoding of an EUI-64 address is similar to the encoding of the
EUI-48 address, except that it can hold callsigns up to 11 characters.

If the callsign is 8 characters or less, then you **MUST** encode your
callsign as an EUI-48 and convert it to an EUI-64 using the standard
EUI-48 to EUI-64 mechanism (using `0xFFFE` for the padding value). For
callsigns larger than 8 characters, we follow similar logic that we
did when constructing the EUI-48:

       7 --Octet 1-- 0   7 --Octet 2-- 0   7 --Octet 3-- 0
    M +---------------+ +---------------+ +---------------+ ...
    S |D|D|D|D|D|0|1|0| |A|A|A|A|A|A|A|A| |A|A|A|A|A|A|A|A| ...
    B +---------------+ +---------------+ +---------------+ ...

                7 --Octet 4-- 0   7 --Octet 5-- 0
           ... +---------------+ +---------------+ ...
           ... |B|B|B|B|B|B|B|B| |B|B|B|B|B|B|B|B| ...
           ... +---------------+ +---------------+ ...

         7 --Octet 6-- 0   7 --Octet 7-- 0   7 --Octet 8-- 0
    ... +---------------+ +---------------+ +---------------+ L
    ... |C|C|C|C|C|C|C|C| |C|C|C|C|C|C|C|C| |D|D|D|D|D|D|D|D| S
    ... +---------------+ +---------------+ +---------------+ B

Where:

 *  `A` is the 16-bit ham address encoding of the first, second, and
    third character of the callsign. Valid values are between `0x0640`
    and `0xF9FF`, inclusive.
 *  `B` is the 16-bit ham address encoding of the fourth, fifth, and
    sixth characters of the callsign. Valid values are between
    `0x0000` and `0xF9FF`, inclusive.
 *  `C` is the 16-bit ham address encoding of the seventh, eighth, and
    ninth characters of the callsign. Valid values are between
    `0x0000` and `0xF9FF`, inclusive.
 *  `D` is the most-significant 13-bits of the 16-bit ham address
    encoding of the tenth and eleventh characters of the callsign. The
    least-significant three bits are always assumed to be zero. Note
    that octet 1 contains bits 7 thru 3 and octet 6 contains bits 15
    thru 8.

So, from our original examples:

 *  `N6DRC`: `5CAC-70F8-0000-0000` becomes `02:5C:AC:FF:FE:70:F8:00`
 *  `VI2BMARC50`: `8B05-0E89-7118-A8C0` becomes
    `C2:8B:05:0E:89:71:18:A8`

## 9-Char EUI-48 and 12-Char EUI-64 {#eui-hack}

The astute reader may realize that there are a few 9-character
callsigns which *can* be encoded into an EUI-48. Likewise, there are a
few 12-character callsigns which can be encoded in an EUI-64. The
trick is that the integer representation of the last character must be
evenly divisible by 8.

Thus, if any of the following characters are the last character of a 9
or 12 character callsign, it can still be represented fully as an
EUI-48 or EUI-64: `H`, `P`, `X`, or `5`.

The issue of whether such a 9-character address should be required
to be encoded as a EUI-48 or a EUI-64 is to be decided. In the
interim, assume EUI-64.
